Today we had a cover lesson. Our cover teacher set us a lesson on completing the micro bit projects, this proved to be difficult but I soon got the hang of it. Although the microbit was hard we learned a lot in the lesson. This was also our first proper taster on programming on our own.

Since it was a cover lesson we didn't really cover as much as we would in a normal lesson this blog is slightly smaller.

WWW: We had a lesson without that much help, so we had to think about how to solve our problems on our own.

EBI: We had our normal IT teacher.
